Program to Explain all data types including signed and unsigned.


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    signed int a = -10; // can able to hold both +ve and -ve values.
    unsigned int b = -20;   // can able to store only +ve values.
    printf("%d %u", a, b);
    return 0;
}

Output:
-10 4294967276
